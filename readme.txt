Simple rougelike game where your objective is to progress down a dungeon comprised of a seemingly endless amount of levels.
Concept is still subject to change.

The game depends on the Windows API for the graphics so it's not able to run on any other platform :/
Tested with:
- gcc version 8.2.0 (MinGW.org GCC-8.2.0-5)
- ...
To compile the game run make in it's folder.
